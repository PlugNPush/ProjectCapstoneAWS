This part is to make sure you are able to evaluate and apply some policy constraintes.

## Policies evaluation

Please evaluate below IAM policies

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowEC2AndS3",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:RunInstances",
        "ec2:TerminateInstances",
        "s3:GetObject",

      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:123456789012:instance/*",
        "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Question: What actions are allowed for EC2 instances and S3 objects based on this policy? What specific resources are included?

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowVPCAccess",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:DescribeVpcs",
        "ec2:DescribeSubnets",
        "ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups"
      ],
      "Resource": "*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "aws:RequestedRegion": "us-west-2"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Question: Under what condition does this policy allow access to VPC-related information? Which AWS region is specified?

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowS3ReadWrite",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["s3:GetObject", "s3:PutObject", "s3:ListBucket"],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket",
        "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*"
      ],
      "Condition": {
        "StringLike": {
          "s3:prefix": ["documents/*", "images/*"]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Question: What actions are allowed on the "example-bucket" and its objects based on this policy? What specific prefixes are specified in the condition?

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowIAMUserCreation",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "iam:CreateUser",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/${aws:username}"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "AllowIAMUserDeletion",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "iam:DeleteUser",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/${aws:username}"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Question: What actions are allowed for IAM users based on this policy? How are the resource ARNs constructed?

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": ["iam:Get*", "iam:List*"],
    "Resource": "*"
  }
}
```

### Questions:

- Which AWS service does this policy grant you access to?
- Does it allow you to create an IAM user, group, policy, or role?
- Go to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/ and in the left navigation expand Reference > Policy Reference > Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys. Choose Identity And Access Management. Scroll to the Actions Defined by Identity And Access Management list.Name at least three specific actions that the **iam:Get\*** action allows.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "ec2:InstanceType": ["t2.micro", "t2.small"]
        }
      },
      "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:instance/*",
      "Action": ["ec2:RunInstances", "ec2:StartInstances"],
      "Effect": "Deny"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Questions:

- What actions does the policy allow?
- Say that the policy included an additional statement object, like this **example:**

```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": "ec2:*"
}
```

- How would the policy restrict the access granted to you by this additional statement?
- If the policy included both the statement on the left and the statement in question 2, could you terminate an m3.xlarge instance that existed in the account?
